# Paperclip Design Principles

**Status:** v0.3 — anchor document for design-language simplification. Governs structure, not brand. Brand values (color, type, iconography) are intentionally unspecified: they are being redesigned and will land as token values only. Nothing in `ui/` may hardcode them. Spacing/radius scales are likewise TBD pending the token audit (see Principle 3).

Changes from v0.2: token layer location corrected to the repo's real source (`ui/src/index.css`); existing token tiers inventoried; snapshot-coverage scope bounded for Run 1; the issue→task copy rename moved out of the zero-visual-change run.

## What this document is for

Agents and humans modifying `ui/` treat this file as the source of truth for design decisions. Storybook is the verification surface — it documents the system; it does not define it. If a change conflicts with this document, change this document first (with review) or change the code.

## Product stance

Paperclip is an operational control plane: org charts, tasks, heartbeat runs, budgets, approvals, audit logs. The user is an operator scanning state and making decisions. Every screen should answer, in order: *what is happening, does it need me, what do I do about it.* Density in service of scanning beats whitespace in service of aesthetics — but density comes from information, never from chrome.

## The token layer (where visual values live)

The single token source is **`ui/src/index.css`** (Tailwind v4; there is no tailwind config file — tokens are CSS custom properties consumed via `@theme`). Do NOT create a parallel token source such as `ui/src/tokens/` — that would produce two sources of truth. If index.css grows unwieldy, extracted values may live in a `tokens.css` **imported by index.css** so the pipeline still has one root.

Tailwind v4 gotcha: `@theme inline` bakes literal values at build time. Any token that must be runtime-tunable (theme editor, dark mode overrides) must be defined in a NON-inline block.

Existing tiers already in index.css (~80+ tokens) — extraction maps to these on **exact value match** before minting anything new:

1. **Semantic tier** — shadcn core set: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring`, `--sidebar-*`, `--chart-1..5` (OKLCH, light/dark overrides).
2. **Brand tier** — agent gradients `--agent-1a/1b..10a/10b` (fixed hex) and status hues `--status-task-*` / `--status-agent-*` (WCAG-tuned; see inline comments).
3. **Domain tier** — match-chip tokens `--chip-match-*`, annotation highlights `--paperclip-doc-annotation-highlight-*`, plus motion/typography tokens.

## Principles

1. **One way to say each thing.** One component per job. One Button, one Card, one Badge, one Table, one EmptyState. Variants are props, not new components. Before creating a component, prove no existing one covers the job.
2. **Tokens are the only source of visual values.** All color, spacing, radius, type size/weight, shadow, and motion values come from the token layer. No hex, no raw px, no ad-hoc Tailwind arbitrary values (`p-[13px]`) in components. If a needed value doesn't exist, add a token — don't inline it. Tailwind palette classes (`bg-red-500`, `text-zinc-400`, etc.) ARE hardcoded values in spirit: they name a literal color, not a semantic role. They are in-scope debt scheduled for a dedicated future run (Run 4, cluster-by-cluster mapping to semantic tokens per doc/design/DECISION-SHEET.md B2) and are not currently gated by check-token-gates. Exception (doc/design/DECISION-SHEET.md B1 user ruling): first-party intentional one-off decoration on demo/UX-lab surfaces stays inline and allowlisted rather than minted as singleton tokens.
3. **Spacing routes through tokens; the scale comes later.** During simplification, extract every spacing and radius value verbatim into tokens — do not normalize, round, or invent a scale. The final scale is a design decision made by a human after reviewing the token audit. Structural rules apply now: vertical rhythm within a container uses one gap value, not per-element margins, and siblings never carry both margin and gap.
4. **Hierarchy through structure, not decoration.** Prefer position, size, and weight over borders, backgrounds, and dividers. Every border, divider, and background fill must justify itself; when in doubt, remove it. A screen should survive the removal of one visual layer.
5. **Status is systematic.** States like running / paused / blocked / awaiting-approval / over-budget map to a single semantic status token set used identically everywhere (badge, row, chart, log). An operator learns the vocabulary once.
6. **Machine values look machine-made.** IDs, costs, token counts, timestamps, and log output use the monospace token and consistent formatting helpers. Never format these ad hoc per screen.
7. **Words are part of the system.** One name per concept across the entire UI — the canonical term is *task* (never *issue* or *ticket* in copy, labels, or empty states). Buttons name the action ("Approve hire," not "Submit"). Errors say what happened and what to do. Empty states say what to do first. **Note:** enforcing the task rename is a visible change and is explicitly OUT of the zero-visual-change extraction run; it happens in its own follow-up run.
8. **Agent-modifiable by design.** The system must be changeable via instructions: single token source, lint rules that enforce it, and this document kept current. A correct change should be expressible as "edit tokens + run checks," not "visit 40 files."

## Form and wizard footers

Keep **Save & exit** (or Cancel/Back) and the primary Continue/Connect/Finish
action in one shared footer row, vertically centered. Put the subdued secondary
action on the left and the primary action on the right. A step owns its whole
footer: do not render Save & exit in a separate parent block below it. Check this
alignment in every step and conditional state, not just the first screen.

Completed Slack setup is a success view: show the full agent avatar, success message,
and one centered Done action. Omit Save & exit after the connection has been
confirmed. The shared footer rule applies to its unfinished setup steps.

## Mobile navigation and text fields

The fixed bottom navigation uses an opaque surface so scrolling content cannot
show through its labels. On touch devices, editable controls use at least the
16px base typography token to prevent Safari's automatic focus zoom. Larger
title sizes remain larger.

The bottom navigation responds to accumulated scrolling, ignoring small
reversals and Safari's edge bounce. It glides out and eases back in with shared
motion tokens; the task composer follows the same motion. Keep page padding
stable while the navigation moves, and honor reduced-motion preferences.

Task conversations reveal their initial comments, interaction cards, plan, and
relevant run history together after positioning the latest message. Keep the
mobile loading surface at a stable viewport height while that history loads;
concealed content must not stretch the document. Background refreshes keep an
already revealed conversation and composer mounted and visible.
Bound the initial wait to 15 seconds. If a request stalls, reveal the available
conversation and composer with a notice that some history is still loading.

Only the viewer's own human comments sit on the right in blue bubbles. Agents
and other humans sit on the left on the page surface, with their own name and
avatar above the message. Human identity comes from the company directory;
missing photos use the shared initials fallback. Match ownership by the stored
author user ID and the authenticated viewer ID, never by display name or the bot
that relayed a message from another channel.

## Contextual feedback

Task chat shows execution errors and waits only while they remain relevant.
Completing or cancelling a task hides its old execution notices. A newer attempt by
the same agent or an explicit successor supersedes earlier run notices; an
unresolved execution hold remains visible. Historical turns keep their responses,
files, questions and inspectable activity without a Worked/Stopped status label.
Run history retains the full diagnostic record. Session reset boundaries remain
in the conversation. Time passing or a new human comment alone does not resolve
an error. Stored notices need run or recovery provenance before they can be hidden;
child-task relays and other unrelated system updates stay visible.

Credential-sharing denials stay expanded as an error card in the task conversation.
Name the agent and selected AI connection when known, and say which person lacks
access. Use “you” only for that person’s own run. Link to the agent’s AI connection
settings; retrying before changing the connection cannot repair a sharing denial.
Show the connection name to the affected user so they can identify what blocked
their task, and to viewers in the connection's human sharing audience. Other task
readers see a generic credential label. Never show credential secrets or grant IDs.
The same run-relevance rules hide the card after a newer attempt or terminal task.

Do not show a toast for task or run state already visible on the current screen.
This includes descendant runs represented by the open subtree. Show local action
results in place; keep failures actionable inline. Notifications for other work
remain useful. Repeated delivery of the same run outcome must refresh cached state
without repeating its toast, including after reconnecting. A terminal outcome
delivered more than five minutes after the run finished is historical and should
refresh state silently. Expected cancellation is neutral gray, not an error. The composer's Stop action stops the current response and leaves the composer available for a new message. Pause work is a separate explicit task or subtree action. A paused task replaces the composer with an amber takeover. It says “Task is
paused.” and “Resume this task to send a message.” with a “Resume task” action.
Subtrees use “Subtree is paused.” and “Resume subtree.” The takeover cannot be
dismissed, retains drafts, and hides message inputs until the pause is released.

Confirmations whose source work is still syncing show “Preparing approval…” and
disable acceptance until the server reports readiness. Refresh that state automatically;
rejection and revision remain available. Live tool reviews keep their own approval flow.

Pending questions, confirmations, and other task-thread inputs appear in a separate
card directly above the ordinary composer. The composer stays available for new
messages while the card is open. Questions use their compact history entry as the
reminder; dismissing one clears the composer and stays effective after reload for
that person and task. Other inputs keep a pending indicator that can reopen them;
resolving or skipping the input removes that indicator.

## Task-row refresh: proposed specimen

The task-row refresh is an explicitly authorized design change following the
extraction run. Its review surface is **Design proposals → Task row design** in Storybook
(`tasks-row-design`), using the production `IssueRow` with
`presentation="task" appearance="refreshed"` and the shared `TaskRowGroup`.
The existing row presentation remains the default while this specimen is reviewed.

Stage this design-system refresh's new token, component, layout, and screen stories
under **Design proposals**, in `ui/storybook/stories/design-proposals/`. Use
`home: "design-proposals"`, `status: "proposed"`, and an explicit staging reason.
These stories are review references and do not count as current production coverage.
They continue to import shared components and the existing token layer; this is
organizational separation, not a second implementation or token source. Use them
for tasks explicitly implementing the refresh. After design review and adoption
in the app, move each suite to its feature or Foundations home and update its
classification while retaining its explicit story ID and exports.

- Comfortable density is 44px; compact density is 32px. Comfortable is the default.
  Compact is a preview for a future user preference, not a new app setting yet.
- All text in proposed task rows and table headers uses the `sm` size token
  (`--text-sm`, 14px) with a 16px line height. This includes metadata, IDs and tag
  chips; keep the same type size at both row densities.
- Titles use Inter: read titles are regular (400), muted foreground; unread titles
  are semibold (600), foreground. Hover changes the row background and title to
  foreground while preserving its read/unread weight. Keyboard focus reveals the
  same title emphasis and retains a visible focus indicator.
- Refreshed task rows indicate unread state through title typography alone. Do not
  show the old blue unread dot or reserve space for it, including in inbox rows.
- Task identifiers use bundled Paper Mono. All visual values live in the
  `--task-row-*` token family in `ui/src/index.css`, mapped to the shared semantic
  color tokens (`--foreground`, `--muted-foreground`, `--border`).
- Keep an 8px gap between the status icon and title in both row specimens and
  the complete column layout. Status icons show their text label in the shared
  tooltip on hover or keyboard focus; clicking still opens the task. Use the
  shared status label, including waiting/blocked context, rather than duplicating
  status copy. Title text continues to use its marquee without a tooltip.
- Titles stay on one line with ellipsis. Every truncated column uses the same
  `CellMarquee`: hover reveals only the cell in that column, scrolling left once
  at a constant speed until the last character is visible, then holding there.
  Moving to another column or leaving the row resets immediately. Fitting cells
  stay still. Keyboard focus also reveals truncated cells; Escape stops the
  reveal. Recheck overflow when width, text, or fonts change. Reduced motion
  jumps to the end without animation. There is no title tooltip; full text
  remains accessible, and the full title stays in the row link's accessible name.
  Truncated edges use a subtle 12px alpha fade into the actual row background,
  including hover, selection and other highlights. Fitting cells have no fade.
  The marquee also fades its clipped leading edge; once it reaches the end, the
  trailing fade clears so the final character remains fully visible. Keep the
  mask inside the focusable cell so keyboard focus outlines stay intact.
- Each nesting level adds 24px inside the title area. Trailing metadata columns
  stay aligned. Thin vertical guides communicate ancestry, with room for disclosure
  controls. Disclosure controls retain independent keyboard and pointer behavior.
- A root task and its visible descendants form one `TaskRowGroup`, bounded by a
  separator above the parent and below its final visible descendant. Child rows
  have no horizontal dividers. Adjacent groups share a single separator. The outer
  nesting guide stops above the bottom separator with the same gap as between
  its top and the parent's status icon.

Review read/unread, actual hover/focus, long titles, both densities, and an expanded
two-level hierarchy before composing the full task-list screen. Story fixtures
show local UI behavior; they do not prove live persistence or task authorization.

### Task-list columns

The complete column order is **Task, Task ID, Created by, Assignee,
Project, Parent Task, Tags, Worktree, Last updated**. The reusable
`TaskListColumnHeader` and `IssueRow`'s `columnValues` share the `--task-list-*`
width tokens and configurable column order. Review the complete composition in
**Design proposals → Task row design → All columns**.

- Created by is the recorded creator (human or agent); Assignee is the current
  assignee. Both show names without avatars. Do not infer either from tree depth
  or task status.
- Task combines the status icon and title under one header and one Columns-menu
  choice. Sorting Task uses the title. Status sorting is unavailable for now.
- Parent Task refers to the structural parent; it can show its ID and title.
- Last updated comes from `updatedAt`. Worktree shows the linked Git worktree's
  branch name. Unassigned tasks say “Unassigned”; other missing values use “—”.
- Default visibility is Task, Task ID, and Last updated. The All columns specimen
  starts with all nine visible for review. Widths are provisional: preserve
  a readable title area and scroll horizontally on narrower screens rather than
  dropping requested fields. Nesting consumes title space; metadata stays aligned.
- Fade clipped left/right edges into the background only while more content is
  hidden on that side. Remove both fades when the table fits. Keep scrolling and
  row controls usable through the fade.
- Tag chips use muted-foreground text on a muted-highlight background
  (`--muted-foreground` and `--muted-highlight`). In dark mode, muted-highlight
  matches Paper's `--dark-color-muted-highlight` (`#333333`).
- The column header stays 44px high in both row densities. Every visible header
  is a keyboard-accessible sort button: a new column starts ascending and repeated
  clicks toggle ascending/descending. The active label and direction arrow use
  foreground on a persistent muted-highlight background; inactive labels use
  muted foreground. Expose `aria-sort`.
  All header backgrounds have 8px of padding on each side. Vertical padding stays 4px.
  Preserve label alignment and column positions across hover states.
  The Task header spans status and title and aligns its label with root-row
  titles. Headers stay left-aligned, with sort arrows to the right. Sorting must
  not move other columns or widen the gap between row status icons and task
  titles. Every column uses the same 12px arrow.
- Drag a header left or right to reorder the entire column, including Task's
  status/title pair and its nested rows. A click still sorts; dragging never
  changes the sort. Alt+Left/Right reorders a focused header. Headers and all
  rows share one grid; widths, nesting and metadata alignment survive reordering.
  Last updated is last in the default table order and flyout order.
- Sorting keeps each parent before its descendants and sorts siblings at every
  level. Task IDs and names use natural, case-insensitive ordering; timestamps use
  their raw value. Tags sort by their
  alphabetized names; missing values stay last in both directions. Equal values
  retain their order. The initial collection uses Task ID ascending as its
  default order, with no active header, direction arrow or persistent highlight.
  A header becomes active only after the user sorts by it; the first click sorts
  ascending.
- A horizontal ellipsis stays pinned to the right edge of the header, outside
  horizontal scrolling. Its “Columns” flyout lists all nine columns in their current order
  with checkmarks on the right. Toggling columns updates both header and rows
  immediately and keeps the flyout open. Keep at least one column visible; nesting
  controls remain available even when Task is hidden. Reset defaults shows only
  Task, Task ID, and Last updated and restores the default column order.
  Reset also clears the active sort, direction arrow and persistent header highlight.
  Other columns remain available in the menu; hiding and re-enabling a column
  preserves its position until reset.
  Hiding the sorted column clears the explicit sort and restores the default
  collection order without highlighting another header.
- The refresh's compact flyout uses the shared DropdownMenu primitives. The
  Paper reference defines a 200px surface with an 8px radius, 12px content
  padding, 32px items separated by 4px, regular-weight muted labels and 14px
  checks on the right. Flyout text uses `sm` (14px) with a 20px line height;
  the heading and Reset defaults use semibold foreground. Hover/focus promotes
  labels and checks to foreground on muted-highlight. The dark surface matches
  Paper's `--dark-color-background` (#1a1a1a), shared by the task list, nesting
  groups, header controls, edge fades and the entire proposal canvas (including
  its document/root background and surrounding content). The flyout has an
  explicit 1px semantic border; the reset outline also uses the semantic tokens.
  Table text retains its 16px line height.
  The existing inbox picker remains tied to its older column contract and descriptions.
  Sort, order and visibility changes in the specimen are local state; saving preferences
  across navigation/reloads belongs to app adoption.

### Task-list page proposal

Review the complete composition in **Design proposals → Task list page**
(`tasks-list-page-design--default`), alongside All Columns and No Results.
This page remains proposed until the design owner approves the surrounding
layout. The Default story shows Task, Task ID and Last updated; the row specimen
and full page consume the same `TaskList` collection.

- `DesignPageShell` composes the existing 240px `SidebarShell`, a 60px page
  header, and scrolling main content with 24px insets. The sidebar uses muted;
  the entire main pane uses Paper's background token. Desktop is the current
  review scope; mobile composition remains to be designed.
  Enable the shared shell's production resize handle, including its hover,
  dragging and keyboard states. Sidebar width persists under the proposal's own
  storage key, separate from the production sidebar preference.
- Sidebar navigation labels use `sm` (14px). Icons match Paper and the existing
  sidebar mappings: CircleCheck, MessageCircle, FolderOpen, Repeat, Package,
  Users, Boxes, Unplug and History. The organization and account controls mount
  `SidebarCompanyMenu` and `SidebarAccountMenu` directly, preserving their
  production keyboard behavior and actions, with the shared refreshed flyout
  appearance. Switching fixture
  organizations changes the selection and never shows another company's tasks.
  The sidebar follows Paper node `32TP-0`: 12px navigation insets, 8px item
  margins and padding, 14px/150% labels, 2px row gaps and 16px section gaps.
  Work and Org captions use the sans family rather than monospace. Recent Tasks
  is a separate final section with five regular-weight, unindented links; it is
  not nested beneath Tasks. The account footer has no divider above it.
  Sidebar surface and right border alias `--muted` and `--border`, matching
  Paper's dark-color-muted and dark-color-border. The task search field uses
  `--background-alt` (Paper dark-color-background-alt: oklch(14.5% 0 0)).
  The organization switcher has no caret in this proposal. Its hit area is
  separate from an adjacent global-search button, which opens the production
  `CommandPalette`; the toolbar input remains a task-list filter.
  `TruncatedTextMarqueeProvider` opts sidebar and menu labels into the same
  `CellMarquee` animation and alpha fade as table cells. Links and buttons own
  focus; labels add no tab stops. Pointer exit resets immediately, Escape stops
  reveal, fitting labels stay still, and reduced motion follows the shared rules.
- `TaskListToolbar` composes shared buttons, input, tooltip, dropdown and filter
  primitives. Controls are 44px high. A 32px gap separates the toolbar and table.
  Page dimensions, spacing, type and surfaces live in the token layer under
  `--design-page-*` and `--design-sidebar-*`.
- Refreshed dropdowns and popovers share `FlyoutAppearanceProvider` and the
  existing Radix primitives. `Flyout` / `FlyoutContent` compose a popover;
  `FlyoutHeader` supports a simple title or profile details, and `FlyoutOptions`
  groups the actions below it. Dropdowns reuse these sections and the appearance
  provider while retaining menu keyboard behavior. Surfaces
  use background, borders use border, hover/focus uses muted-highlight and
  foreground. Unhighlighted labels and their checkmarks use
  `--flyout-item-foreground`, bound to muted-foreground. Selection uses a checkmark,
  including single-choice Views.
  The shared `--shadow-flyout` token controls the subtle drop shadow. All flyout
  visual values live under `--flyout-*`; menu-specific widths stay contextual.
  The account flyout fits its contents and retains production Invite access
  checks. The preview supplies owner access and loaded operator-policy fixtures.
  This appearance remains opt-in while the proposal is reviewed.
  Review the component separately in **Design proposals → Flyout**, with Columns,
  Views and Profile examples. Its Shadow control previews a local override;
  changing the saved `--shadow-flyout` token in `ui/src/index.css` updates every
  refreshed flyout. Storybook controls do not persist token edits.
- Search, unread/completed views and filters operate on fixtures. Matching
  subtasks keep their ancestor chain for context; the result count distinguishes
  matches from contextual parents. Expand/collapse applies to every nested level.
  The grouping icon and menu are omitted from the proposed toolbar.
- List/board switching preserves the list's local column state. The board and
  New Task composer reuse existing components and are not new approved designs.
  Sidebar links exercise the memory router; destination pages, creation API
  behavior, saved preferences and production routes are outside this preview.

The next milestone after full-page visual approval is the agent reference
contract and a fresh-agent reproduction test using these components and tokens.
The staged page itself does not prove that an unfamiliar agent can discover
and reuse the design system.

## Enforcement (what "compliant" means for the extraction run)

- **Zero visual change is proven, not promised:** Storybook visual snapshots are baselined before any refactor, and all snapshots match baseline after it. A change that alters rendered output must be intentional and human-approved.
- **Baseline scope for Run 1:** the shared primitives in `ui/src/components/ui/` (each gets a story if missing — there are only ~24) plus the ~46 existing stories under `ui/storybook/stories/`. Do NOT attempt a story for every feature component (~277) in this run; full coverage is a later effort.
- Mechanical rewrites (value extraction, renames) are done via committed codemod scripts in `scripts/`, not hand-edits — reviewable once, repeatable forever.
- Token layer is the single source (`ui/src/index.css`, per above) consumed via CSS variables / Tailwind theme — never values copied into components.
- Lint/grep gates pass: zero hardcoded hex values, zero arbitrary spacing values, zero raw font-size declarations in `ui/src/components/**` and `ui/src/pages/**` outside the token layer and a documented allowlist (third-party overrides, intentional opt-outs commented inline).
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm build-storybook` pass.
- AGENTS.md links here and states the token-only rule.

Aspirational (NOT gating this run): no duplicate components; every component has exactly one story covering its variants; all UI copy says "task".

## Out of scope (do not do during simplification)

No visual redesign, no new colors or typefaces, no layout restructuring, no new dependencies beyond snapshot tooling, no component consolidation/merges (audit + recommend only), no copy renames, no changes to server code or app logic. Simplification means fewer parts, same product.

## Prior art (read before auditing)

See `doc/design/PRIOR-ART.md` — a previous audit pass (PAP-280/283/284, on the `PAP-282-playground` branch, NOT on master) found that of ~220 hardcoded drift sites, only 6 were exact-value-mappable to existing tokens; expect the verbatim extraction to mint many new tokens that the human scale-collapse step later merges. It also drafted usage rules (radius tiers, CTA tiers, named type styles) that are good candidates for the post-audit scale decision.

How-to guide for day-to-day UI changes: see `doc/design/CHANGING-THE-UI.md`.

## Motion tokens (Task Chat Redesign)

Mobile task panels fill the viewport within the safe area. Their top toolbar shows the current tab title, an open-tab count and selector, an add action, and an X to return to the feed. The selector lists tabs vertically with wrapping titles, an explicit current-tab check, and visible close controls. Each touch control uses the 44px size token. Desktop tabs keep their horizontal layout. Document links within the current task open through the router and retain the feed's reading position and query cache.

The redesigned task thread (flag `enableTaskChatRedesign`) is the first surface to
tokenize motion. Principles — reasoning only; values live in `ui/src/index.css`:

- **One home, and it is `:root`, not `@theme inline`.** `@theme inline` bakes literals
  at build time, so a value placed there cannot be moved at runtime. The dev tweak panel
  tunes motion by writing CSS custom properties live, so every motion token must resolve
  at runtime — hence `:root`.
- **Two tiers.** Primitives (`--motion-duration-*`, `--motion-ease-*`) express the app's
  baseline motion feel; state/component-scoped tokens (`--motion-<state>-*`) reference the
  primitives so the whole thread retunes from a few knobs. Scoped tokens exist so the
  tweak panel can group controls by the state they affect.
- **Reuse the house curves.** New easing defaults point at the two curves already used
  across the app rather than inventing a third feel.
- **No hardcoded timing in components.** Durations, easings, delays, and staggers used by
  the redesigned thread must reference these tokens; a check script rejects raw `ms` /
  `cubic-bezier` values outside `ui/src/index.css`. This discipline is what makes the
  tweak panel structurally possible.
- **Values are placeholders.** The committed numbers are sensible starting points, tuned
  live by a human and pasted back from the tweak panel's export — never treated as final
  during the baseline build.
- **Reduced motion is honored at the token layer.** A `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
  block collapses the duration/stagger tokens to zero, cascading to every scoped token,
  in addition to each animation's own component-level guard.

Agent Chat and regular task chats keep pending questions as compact “Unanswered question” entries at their original position in history. Dismissing the form or sending a newer user message clears it from the composer without resolving it. Questions never contribute to composer pending counts or navigation. Opening the history entry restores the original form and its draft; submitting later uses the same durable question response path. Actual permission reviews retain their permission checks.
